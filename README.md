# Recommendation-Engines-for-the-IBM-Watson-Studio-Platform

## Summary
IBM has an online data science community where members can post tutorials, notebooks, articles, and datasets. In this project, I built various recommendation engines, 
based on user behavior and social network for the IBM Watson Studio's data platform, to surface content most likely to be relevant to a user.
